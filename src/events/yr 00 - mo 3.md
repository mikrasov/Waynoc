You learned to recognize faces. <IncreaseStat stat="INTELLIGENCE"/>

To look around. <IncreaseStat stat="PERCEPTION"/>

To lift your head. <IncreaseStat stat="STRENGTH"/>

To hold your head steady. <IncreaseStat stat="STAMINA"/>

To smile at people. <IncreaseStat stat="PRESENCE"/>

To coo and babble.  <IncreaseStat stat="COMMUNICATION"/>

To suck on your hand. <IncreaseStat stat="DEXTERITY"/>

To swing at dangling toys. <IncreaseStat stat="QUICKNESS"/>

You learned your name. (George)
