title: The Journey Starts
---

A recollection awakens you out of a deep slumber. Some un-done act, now a faint memory of a body you no longet have pushes you awake. 
What was it? Something undone? Some regret? It was so important when you were corporeal, and now.... 

Well whatever it was, its impact can still reach you. Even here in the encompassing unmoving blackness. 

You have to go back. But how?

<Prompt> What do you do? </Prompt>

<Choice label="Examine The Darkness">

You search, without eyes. You scan the great void, across towns, and history, looking for something, anything to break you out of this void.

At last, you see it! A light! Familiar. Beckoning.

<Prompt> What do you do? </Prompt>

<Choice label="Move towards the light">

As you get closer, what you thought was one light is in fact two distinct points.
Packed so closely together, and so faint and flickering you couldn't tell them apart.

While you lack anything one could call a sense, you know that one light belongs to a girl, the other a boy.
As you observe, the lights seem to dim with every flicker. 

You must hurry. Choose!


<Prompt> Which light do you focus on? </Prompt>

<Choice label="The Girl">
    
You focus on the **girl** and the light fills your vision.  <Set silent gender value="female"></Set>

A sudden burst of pressure all around feels like it is about to crush you.
The pressure comes in rapid waves, propelling your frail body forward.
Then suddenly the pressure is gone and your senses are flooded with light, sound, touch and smell.
Its oh so cold and you feel at once as if you made a terrible mistake. 


Behind you screaming fills the room. As powerful hands lift you up you see the silent form of a baby boy, blue, unmoving, 
covered in blood, thrown out into the arms of a giant.

You scream.
